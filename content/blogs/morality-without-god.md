A few days ago, while having tea with friends after work, we got into one of those serious discussions about life. When the question of morality came up, a colleague inquired, "Can you be a good person without believing in God?" One of them explained that his life, without belief in God, had been full of joy and purpose. Another noted that atheism leaves one in more of an ambiguous space leading to nihilism. I, on the other hand, remained silent, but it's something I have been thinking about for a very long time, and honestly, I have mixed feelings about it.

For some people, morality and religion go hand in hand, with the idea that God's command serves as the foundation of morality. While some, believe that one can become a good person by acting ethically and treating others well without needing to tie their actions to a divine being. But a question arises: **"On what basis do we determine what is right or wrong?"**

## Argument for morality being tied to God.

Religious teachings provide a clear explanation of what is considered to be right and wrong. According to this view, one may argue that without a higher authority, what's stopping people from choosing to act in self-interest? As [C.S. Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis), the famous Christian writer and philosopher, once said, **"The moral law tells us the tune we have to play: our instincts are the strings."**

Another classic example of God's role in morality is the [**"Divine Command Theory"**](https://iep.utm.edu/divine-command-theory/). According to this theory, what's morally right is determined by God's command. Actions are morally right because God says they are and vice versa. A key strength of this argument is that it provides a clear, unchanging standard. It's the same for everyone, everywhere, and remains constant throughout.

## The case for morality without God.

>_**"Morality is not the doctrine of how we may make ourselves happy, but how we may make ourselves worthy of happiness."**_  -- [Immanuel Kant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant)

Many scholars argue that we can be moral even without God if we have a strong sense of right and wrong, reason, and empathy. The key is to understand that we should treat others as we would like to be treated. Our ability to reason about what is best for humanity can contribute to a more just and compassionate world. For example, countries with high levels of secularism such as Denmark, Sweden, Netherlands have low crime rates and strong emphasis on human rights while significant portion of the population identifying as non religious.

Another perspective is that morality is a social construct, a set of rules designed to facilitate peaceful coexistence. Rather than relying on religious prohibitions we can prioritize outcomes that are grounded in individual well being. For example, promoting education, healthcare, freedom, free speech and equality can create a society in which individuals can live a happy and fulfilling lives.

So, what do I think? Well, I see value in both sides. Treating others well, showing empathy, and being grounded in reason while believing in God for valuable guidance. It's a balance of both that can play a crucial role in shaping one's moral compass.
