## What exactly is Free Will?

To me, free will is the idea that we have the power of making choices that are not predetermined by the past or aren't affected by external conditions. It's the sense of having control over our actions and the ability to choose different possible paths.

## The Illusion of Choice

When I consider the possibility that my choies are not as free as I believe, I start to wonder whether free will really exists? or is it just an illusion we've created for ourselves. Here's how I am delaing with this concept.

### Role of Upbringing

Our character is deeply influenced by out upbringing and personal experiences. From our childhood, the values imparted by society and culture begin to mold our preferences of choices. For instance, consider someone born in a family where acedemic achievements are highly valued. This early emphasis instills a strong preference for academic and career success. If this person then chooses to pursue a career in let's say medicine, it will be heavily influenced by their background and values imparted in them from a young age.
Similarly personal experiences can also shape our choices. For example, if a person spent significant time volunteering in a medical setting. It is very likely to reinforce their desire to persue medicine.

These early influences shape the desire and choices making it harder to seperate decisions from the environments that raised them.

### The Paradox of Responsibility

Sometimes I think about when I look back at my life and wonder how things could've been different if I had made other choices. We all do. It's a natural feeling because we want to control our future and improve our lives. However this desire also creates a paradox: while I want to change my past, I also need to accept that I am responsible for the decisions I have made.

### Embracing Uncertainity

Imagine choosing between two job offers. One in a city where you've always dreamed of living, while the other is close to your family and friends. it is tempting to find clear-cut answers whether our decisions are entirely ours or shaped by other factors, but the reality is more complex.

Accepting that both personal desires and external factors shape our choices means acknowledging the uncertainty in decision-making. Instead of finding a clear solution, we are left with the complexity of navigating these influences. This uncertainty reflects the intricate nature of human choices, where the lines between free will and external factors blur, leaving us with more questions than answers

## Conclusion

Free will means we think we can control our choices, but many things like our upbringing and experiences influence what we decide. Although we want to believe our decisions are entirely our own, they are often shaped by these factors. Understanding this helps us see that free will is a mix of personal choices and outside influences, showing that decision-making is more complex than just being completely free.
