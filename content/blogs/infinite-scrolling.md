I recently watched a documentary about how technology is designed to keep us hooked, and it really made me rethink how I use my phone. The design feature of infinite scrolling is a prime example of this. It’s meant to be convenient, but it’s actually a huge time sink that affects our productivity and well-being.


Infinite scrolling was created to keep us engaged. Instead of stopping at the bottom of a page and clicking to see more, the content just keeps coming. This seems like a small convenience, but it’s actually a powerful tool to keep us hooked. As Nir Eyal, author of *Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products*, explains, “The goal of these features is to make the product as engaging as possible, so users spend more time on it.”

I’ve noticed this myself on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. What starts as a quick check of my feed turns into hours of scrolling. The endless stream of posts, videos, and images is designed to keep me scrolling indefinitely. It’s like a digital treadmill—you’re moving but not really going anywhere.


Infinite scrolling doesn’t just waste time; it erodes our ability to focus. I’ve found that after a session of endless scrolling, I struggle to concentrate on tasks that require deep work. A study from the University of California, Irvine, found that people who frequently switch between tasks, like scrolling through social media, experience a decline in productivity and increased stress.

I’ve experienced this firsthand. I’ll start scrolling through my feed and suddenly realize that hours have passed, and I haven’t made a dent in my to-do list. It’s as if my productivity has been drained by the endless feed.


The effects of infinite scrolling extend beyond just wasted time—it can also impact mental health. Constant exposure to idealized images and posts can lead to feelings of inadequacy. According to a study published in *JAMA Network Open*, heavy social media use is linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression.

I’ve felt this myself. Seeing curated images of perfect vacations and flawless lifestyles can make me feel like I’m missing out or not measuring up. It’s a constant reminder of what I don’t have, which can be demoralizing.


Breaking free from infinite scrolling isn’t easy, but there are ways to take back control. I’ve started setting time limits on my social media apps to prevent myself from falling into the trap of endless scrolling. Apps like Screen Time on iOS or Digital Wellbeing on Android can help with this.

Additionally, I’ve made an effort to focus on more meaningful content. Instead of mindlessly scrolling, I now look for posts and articles that add value to my life. For instance, I follow accounts that offer educational content or inspiration rather than just entertainment.

Another effective strategy is to create tech-free zones in my life. I’ve started keeping my phone away from the dining table and making sure I don’t use it right before bed. This simple change has helped me reclaim time for activities that genuinely enrich my life, like reading or spending quality time with loved ones.


Infinite scrolling is a clever but insidious design feature that can dominate our time, focus, and mental health. By being mindful of how we use our devices, setting boundaries, and focusing on meaningful content, we can reduce the negative impact of infinite scrolling. It’s all about regaining control over our time and attention, and making sure we use technology in a way that truly benefits us.
